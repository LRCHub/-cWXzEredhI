You know me
I take nothing seriously
I can see a laughing face in every willow tree

But I'd rather be the queen at the guillotine
In a bloody insurrection
I would rather be king when the rooks take wing
Than be losing your affection

Willow trees lose their leaves in the autumn breeze
Then there's these trees that stay green for centuries

But I'd rather be the queen at the guillotine
In a bloody insurrection
I would rather be king when the rooks take wing
Than be losing your affection

Losing your affection

I would rather rub the hair of a bear in a lair
In the opposite direction
I would rather put the make on a rattlesnake
Than be losing your affection

I would rather be the frog speaking Tagalog
As they start the vivisection
I would rather be the dog food in front of the dog
Than be losing your affection

But I'd rather be the queen at the guillotine
In a bloody insurrection
I would rather be king when the rooks take wing
Than be losing your affection

I would rather rub the hair of a bear in a lair
In the opposite direction
I would rather put the make on a rattlesnake
Than be losing your affection

I would rather be the frog speaking Tagalog
As they start the vivisection
I would rather be the dog food in front of the dog
Than be losing your affection
