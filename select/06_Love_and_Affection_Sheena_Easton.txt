I am not in love, but I'm open to persuasion
East or west, where's the best for romancing?
With a friend I can smile
But with a lover I could hold my head back
Really laugh, really laugh

Thank you, you took me dancing
Cross the floor, cheek to cheek
But with a lover I could really move
Really dance, really dance, really move
If I can feel the sun in my eyes
And the rain on my face
Why can't I feel?

Love and affection
Sing me another love song
But this time with a little dedication
Sing it, sing it
You know that's what I like, love, make love
Once more with feeling

With friends I still feel so insecure
Little darling I believe you could help me a lot
Just take my hand and lead me where you will
No conversation, no wave goodnight
Just give me love, make

Love with affection
Sing me another love song
But this time with a little dedication
Sing it, sing it
You know that's what I like, love, make love
Once more with feeling

Give me love, give me love, love, ooh

Give me love, make love with affection
Sing me another love song
But this time with a little dedication
Sing it, sing it, sing it
You know that's what I like, love oo-whoo!
Make love with affection
Give me love, give me love, ooh,
Give me love, give me love...
