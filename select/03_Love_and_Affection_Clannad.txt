You play games in the street
Who to trust and who to meet
Sweet justice hard to find
Say the same with deceit
Take no blame in defeat
Sweet justice hard to find

All I wanted was love and affection
All I wanted was love and affection

Lonely child roams around
As someone else goes underground
All trying to make ends meet
Trouble staring, is life so cheap?

All they wanted was love and affection
All they wanted was love and affection

Broken dreams in the street
True sensations, the stories leak
Sweet justice hard to find
Can't simply speak my mind

All I wanted was love and affection
All they wanted was love and affection
All I wanted was love and affection
And all they wanted was love and
Affection
